				<p>“So what have you decided? You’re going to tell your Dad about it?” I asked Sushant.</p>

<p>It was 25th of April, 2010. We were sitting at a bar in Delhi and Sushant was gulping glasses of beer at a go. Today IPL 2010 came to the end with Chennai Super Kings wining over Mumbai Indians in a much unexpected match and leaving Sushant out of 50 thousand bucks with which he was supposed to pay the hostel fee. Those days betting on IPL matches was the “in-thing” at boy’s hostels. Everyone had their bet but some people took it a little too far, so as to lose a hefty sum of money. 50k is quite a sum for a college guy. But like always Sushant’s face hasn’t lost its calmness.</p>

<p>“Dad doesn’t need to know about my loss, I’ll earn my money back.” he said with a smirk.</p>

<p>“Do you even have any idea what you are talking about?” At the moment I was much more tensed than he seemed to be.</p>

<p>I had known Sushant all my life. we went to same high school at Patna and finally took admission in the same college, GIT Delhi. He was a true trouble magnet. I can’t tell of a single year in his life which had passed by without one or two big issues. So there we were drinking beer; with him in deep shit, smiling with a supposedly weird solution in his head and me worried about him.</p>

<p>“Have you heard about the poker group in M block? I’ll play with them and earn my hostel fee back.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you missing the most important thing?”</p>

<p>“Nah! I’ve got everything fixed.  I have got a jack to their group and we are playing tonight.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know how to play Blackjack you jackass. And what about the initial money you require, have you got any money?”</p>

<p>“Ah! I thought you’ll ask that, I’ve read everything about Blackjack a.k.a 21. It’s just maths and you know I’ve a gifted mind for maths.”he said with a wink,”and as far as money is concerned that’s where you come to play. You’re lending me 1 thousand bucks for tonight.”</p>

<p>“Dude you serious? You never even asked me, what if I say no?”</p>

<p>“you are my bro, I know you like I know my weeds or even better. You’ve got the money and you’re giving me tonight.”</p>

<p>“Just don’t lose my money.”</p>

<p>It was 5 am when I received Sushant’s call the next day, even before I could say hello in my half asleep mode a sound came over.</p>

<p>“Dude this blackjack is awesome. I’m coming to your room and yeah I’ve made 10k last night.” he screamed in his usual happy voice.</p>

<p>“yeah, come over.”, I said and slept again.</p>

<p>It was 9 in the monday morning and we were sitting at the hostel’s mess having our breakfast. Sushant was describing every itsy bitsy detail of the last night and how his love for maths has grown even more after his win.</p>

<p>“So you’re sure you’re not going to get addicted to this.”</p>

<p>“Nah! I’ll only play until I win my 50k back.”</p>

<p>“Good luck with that. I’m not sure about blackjack replacing betting as your addiction.”</p>

<p>“Don’t act like my mommy.”, he grumbled.</p>

<p>After few sessions with M block guys, he won all the money he required and even some more. He promised me that he won’t be playing with them again but he had to do something with his recently acquired skill. He was not the kind of guy to sit idle. Finally he decided to make an blackjack application for android platform. Being a student of Computer Engineer, it was not hard for him to design the basic layout for the game. But what would have made his game exclusive was the main concern. After 2-3 weeks he came to my room with 3 pages scribbled with numbers and letters.</p>

<p>“What’s this?”, I asked.</p>

<p>“This is the algorithm for my game, and it will make my new game ’21 to millions’ famous.”</p>

<p>“A weird name you’ve thought of.”</p>

<p>“Just like me. people start playing game 21 and get to win million. smart eh?”</p>

<p>“very.”, I smiled.</p>

<p>Only in few weeks the download count of the app increased to thousand. It was free and even after so much fame he decided it to leave free, he was different.  After few months a recent engineering graduate from a college in Boston contacted him to talk about his game and his interest in software development. After few chatting session and mutual interest at the same thing they decided to co-found a software development company once Sushant completes his degree in 2012.</p>

<p>Same bar we started but the year rolled to 2013. He was too lost in his thought to answer my question at first. I shook him to ask again, “So what have you decided? You’re going to tell your Dad about it?”</p>

<p>“I guess so, but can’t tell him on the phone, it’s THE face news. They’re our first sponsor and they’re funding us half a million dollars. So I’ve to get to New York by April 15th.”</p>
